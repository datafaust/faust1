#The Overall Projects

I've built a couple of drones over the last year and I've been wanting to expand the larger one's utility beyond flight and gps modes. Specifically I want to add sensors to collect weather data along with sensors that will help with collision avoidance.

```{r}
#insert raspberry pi image
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/fausto/Documents/R/win-library/3.4/faust1/public/img/pi_zero.jpg")
```


I've recently been working a lot with the raspberry pi, specifically the zero w and as it's small and light the pi makes a great onboard computer for a quadcopter.
