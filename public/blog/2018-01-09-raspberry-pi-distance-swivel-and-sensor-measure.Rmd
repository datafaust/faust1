#The Overall Projects

I've built a couple of drones over the last year and I've been wanting to expand the larger one's utility beyond flight and gps modes. Specifically I want to add sensors to collect weather data along with sensors that will help with collision avoidance.

```{r, warning = F, echo = F}
#insert raspberry pi image
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/fausto/Documents/R/win-library/3.4/faust1/public/img/pi_zero.jpg")
```


I've recently been working a lot with the raspberry pi, specifically the zero w and as it's small and light the pi makes a great onboard computer for a quadcopter. 


#The First Objective 

I decided to start with the simple 

```{r, warning = F}

```


#Installing the Software

```{r}

```

#Step1: Measure Distance

```{r}

```

#Step2: Swivel

```{r}

```

#Step3: Measure one weather aspect
