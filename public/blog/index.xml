      <description>Video AnalyticsI had a recent project proposal in which I was to do something very interesting with data and rather than download some data set to work with I thought it be fun to work on something new. For some time I have been interested in getting into computer vision and now that I build and fly drones merging the two just seems inevitable. So I spent the last weekend learning how to work with this, most of it in python and then a little bit of it in R for fun.</description>

      <description>Why build an image database?In a previous post I went over how to pull in video data and parse out frames for processing. That’s really useful for pulling in the data you ultimately want to screen, but at times there is also a need for having other images. You may want to classify certain objects as they appear in other videos, or build Haarcascades with specific images. Regardless you’ll need to access images.</description>

      <description>The Overall ProjectsI’ve built a couple of drones over the last year and I’ve been wanting to expand the larger one’s utility beyond flight and gps modes. Specifically I want to add sensors to collect weather data along with sensors that will help with collision avoidance.
#insert raspberry pi imageknitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;C:/Users/fausto/Documents/R/win-library/3.4/faust1/public/img/pi_zero.jpg&amp;quot;)I’ve recently been working a lot with the raspberry pi, specifically the zero w and as it’s small and light the pi makes a great onboard computer for a quadcopter.</description>

      <description>What does our data look like?The objective of this report is to use our open data portal to look at which companies in the taxi for-hire vehicle sector output the most volume of trips over time; by understanding the “top players” in the industry we can establish our reasoning behind the publishing of selective indicators referencing these companies. We leverage the FHV Base Aggregate report on Open Data; below is a sample of what the first 100 rows of that data looks like:</description>
