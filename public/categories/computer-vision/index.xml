      <description>Video AnalyticsI had a recent project proposal in which I was to do something very interesting with data and rather than download some data set to work with I thought it be fun to work on something new. For some time I have been interested in getting into computer vision and now that I build and fly drones merging the two just seems inevitable. So I spent the last weekend learning how to work with this, most of it in python and then a little bit of it in R for fun.</description>
